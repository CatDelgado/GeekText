# Geek-Text
This is a group project done for CEN4010: Software Engineering I. My team and I used Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS to implement a website for books that can be viewed by Top Sellers, Ratings, Genres, Authors, etc. All of the books are pulled from the database we created using MongoDB. Each user is able to create an account, leave reviews on the books, and even purchase a book. If you are not ready to purchase yet, you can always add a book to your wishlist.

In order to run this site, you will need to install: flask, python-dotenv, requsts, authlib, pymongo, bootstrap.

Thank you.
